At that time, Robert Young (1966) and others denigrated then standard textbook histories of psychology for their amateurism and their justifications propaganda for specific standpoints in current psychology, disguised as history. Since then, at least some textbooks writers and working historians of psychology have made such criticisms their own (Leahey 1986; Furumoto 1989). The demand for textbook histories continues nonetheless. Psychology, at least in the United States, remains the only discipline that makes historical representations of itself in the form of ``history and systems'' courses an official part of its pedagogical canon, required, interestingly enough, for the license in clinical practice (see Ash 1983).1 In the meantime, the professionalization of scholarship in history of psychology has proceeded apace. All of the trends visible in historical and social studies of other sciences, as well as in general cultural and intellectual history, are noe present in the historical study of psychology. Yet despite the visibility and social importance of psychology's various applications, and the prominence of certain schools of psychological thought such as behaviorism and psychoanalysis in contemporary cultural and political debate, the historiography of psychology has continued to hold a marginal position in history and social studies of science.},

The results obtained by the teams differed extensively. Many concluded from this widely noted exercise that the social sciences are not rigorous enough to provide definitive answers. In this article, we investigate why results diverged so much. We argue that the main reason was an unclear research question: Teams differed in their interpretation of the research question and therefore used diverse research designs and model specifications. We show by reanalyzing the data that with a clear research question, a precise definition of the parameter of interest, and theory-guided causal reasoning, results vary only within a narrow range. The broad conclusion of our reanalysis is that social science research needs to be more precise in its ?estimands? to become credible.},

Several reviews of the psychological literature have shown that around 96\% of papers involving the use of null hypothesis significance testing report significant outcomes for their main results but that the typical studies are insufficiently powerful for such a track record. We explain this paradox by showing that the use of several small underpowered samples often represents a more efficient research strategy (in terms of finding p {$<$} .05) than does the use of one larger (more powerful) sample. Publication bias and the most efficient strategy lead to inflated effects and high rates of false positives, especially when researchers also resorted to questionable research practices, such as adding participants after intermediate testing. We provide simulations that highlight the severity of such biases in meta-analyses. We consider 13 meta-analyses covering 281 primary studies in various fields of psychology and find indications of biases and/or an excess of significant results in seven. These results highlight the need for sufficiently powerful replications and changes in journal policies.},

In response to this problem, a lot of attention has recently been drawn to sequential analyses. This type of procedure has been shown to be more efficient (to require less observations and therefore less resources) than classical fixed-N procedures. However, these procedures are submitted to both intrapersonal and interpersonal biases during data collection and data analysis. In this tutorial, we explain how automation can be used to prevent these biases. We show how to synchronise open and free experiment software programs with the Open Science Framework and how to automate sequential data analyses in R. This tutorial is intended to researchers with beginner experience with R but no previous experience with sequential analyses is required.},

  abstract = {The term psi denotes anomalous processes of information or energy transfer that are currently unexplained in terms of known physical or biological mechanisms. Two variants of psi are precognition (conscious cognitive awareness) and premonition (affective apprehension) of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process. Precognition and premonition are themselves special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of some future event on an individual's current responses, whether those responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective. This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by ``time-reversing'' well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur. Data are presented for 4 time-reversed effects: precognitive approach to erotic stimuli and precognitive avoidance of negative stimuli; retroactive priming; retroactive habituation; and retroactive facilitation of recall. The mean effect size (d) in psi performance across all 9 experiments was 0.22, and all but one of the experiments yielded statistically significant results. The individual-difference variable of stimulus seeking, a component of extraversion, was significantly correlated with psi performance in 5 of the experiments, with participants who scored above the midpoint on a scale of stimulus seeking achieving a mean effect size of 0.43. Skepticism about psi, issues of replication, and theories of psi are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Focused on interpreting data as statistical evidence, the evidential paradigm uses likelihood ratios to measure the strength of statistical evidence. Under this paradigm, re-examination of accumulating evidence is encouraged because (i) the likelihood ratio, unlike a p-value, is una ected by the number of examinations and (ii) the probability of observing strong misleading evidence is naturally low, even for study designs that re-examine the data with each new observation. Further, the controllable probabilities of observing misleading and weak evidence provide assurance that the study design is reliable without a ecting the strength of statistical evidence in the data. This paper illustrates the ideas and methods associated with using likelihood ratios to measure statistical evidence. It contains a comprehensive introduction to the evidential paradigm, including an overview of how to quantify the probability of observing misleading evidence for various study designs. The University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a classic and still controversial multi-centred clinical trial, is used as an illustrative example. Some of the original UGDP results, and subsequent re-analyses, are presented for comparison purposes. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {After 4 decades of severe criticism, the ritual of null hypothesis significance testing (mechanical dichotomous decisions around a sacred .05 criterion) still persists. This article reviews the problems with this practice, including near universal misinterpretation of p as the probability that H{$_0$} is false, the misinterpretation that its complement is the probability of successful replication, and the mistaken assumption that if one rejects H{$_0$} one thereby affirms the theory that led to the test. Exploratory data analysis and the use of graphic methods, a steady improvement in and a movement toward standardization in measurement, an emphasis on estimating effect sizes using confidence intervals, and the informed use of available statistical methods are suggested. For generalization, psychologists must finally rely, as has been done in all the older sciences, on replication. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The situations include multiple testing, deciding when to stop running participants, and when a theory was thought of relative to finding out results. The interpretation of nonsignificant results has also been persistently problematic in a way that Bayesian inference can clarify. The Bayesian and orthodox approaches are placed in the context of different notions of rationality, and I accuse myself and others as having been irrational in the way we have been using statistics on a key notion of rationality.

These properties help solve some (but not all) of the problems underlying the credibility crisis in psychology. The symmetry of the measure of evidence means that there can be evidence for H0 just as much as for H1; or the Bayes factor may indicate insufficient evidence either way. P-values cannot make this three-way distinction. Thus, Bayes factors indicate when the data count against a theory (and when they count for nothing); and thus they indicate when replications actually support H0 or H1 (in ways that power cannot). There is every reason to publish evidence supporting the null as going against it, because the evidence can be measured to be just as strong either way (thus the published record can be more balanced). Bayes factors can be B-hacked but they mitigate the problem because a) they allow evidence in either direction so people will be less tempted to hack in just one direction; b) as a measure of evidence they are insensitive to the stopping rule; c) families of tests cannot be arbitrarily defined; and d) falsely implying a contrast is planned rather than post hoc becomes irrelevant (though the value of pre-registration is not mitigated).},

And how should ``failed'' replications affect our belief in the validity of the original research? In this paper, we consider the ``replication'' debate from a historical and philosophical perspective, and provide a conceptual analysis of both replication and falsification as they pertain to this important discussion. Along the way, we introduce a Bayesian framework for assessing ``failed'' replications in terms of how they should affect our confidence in purported findings.},

These meetings resulted in opposite decisions by the advisory committee. The crux of the argumentation was the two-positive-trial FDA paradigm. Carvedilol did not meet the usual paradigm because an exercise end point was not statistically different from placebo in three U.S. trials. Most other end points were highly significant, and death, which was monitored across the U.S. program, was different with p {$<$} 0.0001. Here we argue that the usual paradigm is very useful but not an absolute principle, that the usual paradigm can sometimes miss the strength of evidence even in the primary end points, and that rational decision making requires on occasion that other evidence must lead to approval. Control of the type I error rate should be taken very seriously, should rarely be violated, and serves the biomedical community well. It is not an absolute principle, however, but rather must be considered in context.},

This form of surrogate science fosters delusions and borderline cheating and has done much harm, creating, for one, a flood of irreproducible results.

  abstract = {Originally published in 1987, this title is about theory construction in psychology. Where theories come from, as opposed to how they become established, was almost a no-man's land in the history and philosophy of science at the time. The authors argue that in the science of mind, theories are particularly likely to come from tools, and they are especially concerned with the emergence of the metaphor of the mind as an intuitive statistician. In the first chapter, the authors discuss the rise of the inference revolution, which institutionalized those statistical tools that later became theories of cognitive processes. In each of the four following chapters they treat one major topic of cognitive psychology and show to what degree statistical concepts transformed their understanding of those topics.},

Roughly one third of Americans are skeptical that humans are primarily responsible for climate change; rates of some infectious diseases are climbing in the face of anti-immunization beliefs; and significant numbers of the population worldwide are antievolution creationists. It is easy to assume that resistance to an evidence-based message is a result of ignorance or failure to grasp evidence (the "deficit model" of science communication). But increasingly, theorists understand there are limits to this approach, and that if people are motivated to reject science, then repeating evidence will have little impact. In an effort to create a transtheoretical language for describing these underlying motivations, we introduce the notion of "attitude roots." Attitude roots are the underlying fears, ideologies, worldviews, and identity needs that sustain and motivate specific "surface" attitudes like climate skepticism and creationism. It is the antiscience attitude that people hear and see, but it is the attitude root-what lies under the surface-that allows the surface attitudes to survive even when they are challenged by evidence. We group these attitude roots within 6 themes-worldviews, conspiratorial ideation, vested interests, personal identity expression, social identity needs, and fears and phobias-and review literature relevant to them. We then use these insights to develop a "jiu jitsu" model of persuasion that places emphasis on creating change by aligning with (rather than competing with) these attitude roots.

Group sequential methods provide a means to balance the ethical and financial advantages of stopping a study early against the risk of an incorrect conclusion.Group Sequential Methods with Applications to Clinical Trials describes group sequential stopping rules designed to reduce average study length and control Type I and II error probabilities. The authors present one-sided and two-sided tests, introduce several families of group sequential tests, and explain how to choose the most appropriate test and interim analysis schedule. Their topics include placebo-controlled randomized trials, bio-equivalence testing, crossover and longitudinal studies, and linear and generalized linear models.Research in group sequential analysis has progressed rapidly over the past 20 years. Group Sequential Methods with Applications to Clinical Trials surveys and extends current methods for planning and conducting interim analyses. It provides straightforward descriptions of group sequential hypothesis tests in a form suited for direct application to a wide variety of clinical trials. Medical statisticians engaged in any investigations planned with interim analyses will find this book a useful and important tool.},

A second conceptual distinction is between frequentist methods and Bayesian methods. Our main goal in this article is to explain how Bayesian methods achieve the goals of the New Statistics better than frequentist methods.

  abstract = {Running studies with high statistical power, while effect size estimates in psychology are often inaccurate, leads to a practical challenge when designing an experiment. This challenge can be addressed by performing sequential analyses while the data collection is still in progress. At an interim analysis, data collection can be stopped whenever the results are convincing enough to conclude that an effect is present, more data can be collected, or the study can be terminated whenever it is extremely unlikely that the predicted effect will be observed if data collection would be continued. Such interim analyses can be performed while controlling the Type 1 error rate. Sequential analyses can greatly improve the efficiency with which data are collected. Additional flexibility is provided by adaptive designs where sample sizes are increased on the basis of the observed effect size. The need for pre-registration, ways to prevent experimenter bias, and a comparison between Bayesian approaches and null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) are discussed. Sequential analyses, which are widely used in large-scale medical trials, provide an efficient way to perform high-powered informative experiments. I hope this introduction will provide a practical primer that allows researchers to incorporate sequential analyses in their research. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The TOST procedure can be used to determine if an observed effect is surprisingly small, given that a true effect at least as extreme as the SESOI exists. We explain a range of approaches to determine the SESOI in psychological science and provide detailed examples of how equivalence tests should be performed and reported. Equivalence tests are an important extension of the statistical tools psychologists currently use and enable researchers to falsify predictions about the presence, and declare the absence, of meaningful effects.},

When proposing alternatives to p-values statisticians often commit the `Statistician's Fallacy', where they declare which statistic researchers really `want to know'. Instead of telling researchers what they want to know, statisticians should teach researchers which questions they can ask. In some situations, the answer to the question they are most interested in will be the p-value. As long as null-hypothesis tests have been criticized, researchers have suggested to include minimum-effect tests and equivalence tests in our statistical toolbox, and these tests (even though they return p-values) have the potential to greatly improve the questions researchers ask. It is clear there is room for improvement in how we teach p-values. If anyone really believes p-values are an important cause of problems in science, preventing the misinterpretation of p-values by developing better evidence-based education and user-centered statistical software should be a top priority. Telling researchers which statistic they should use has distracted us from examining more important questions, such as asking researchers what they want to know when they do scientific research. Before we can improve our statistical inferences, we need to improve our statistical questions.},

  abstract = {Mounting failures of replication in social and biological sciences give a new urgency to critically appraising proposed reforms. This book pulls back the cover on disagreements between experts charged with restoring integrity to science. It denies two pervasive views of the role of probability in inference: to assign degrees of belief, and to control error rates in a long run. If statistical consumers are unaware of assumptions behind rival evidence reforms, they can't scrutinize the consequences that affect them (in personalized medicine, psychology, etc.). The book sets sail with a simple tool: if little has been done to rule out flaws in inferring a claim, then it has not passed a severe test. Many methods advocated by data experts do not stand up to severe scrutiny and are in tension with successful strategies for blocking or accounting for cherry picking and selective reporting. Through a series of excursions and exhibits, the philosophy and history of inductive inference come alive. Philosophical tools are put to work to solve problems about science and pseudoscience, induction and falsification.},

  abstract = {Psychological theories are statements of constraint. The role of hypothesis testing in psychology is to test whether specific theoretical constraints hold in data. Bayesian statistics is well suited to the task of finding supporting evidence for constraint, because it allows for comparing evidence for 2 hypotheses against each another. One issue in hypothesis testing is that constraints may hold only approximately rather than exactly, and the reason for small deviations may be trivial or uninteresting. In the large-sample limit, these uninteresting, small deviations lead to the rejection of a useful constraint. In this article, we develop several Bayes factor 1-sample tests for the assessment of approximate equality and ordinal constraints. In these tests, the null hypothesis covers a small interval of non-0 but negligible effect sizes around 0. These Bayes factors are alternatives to previously developed Bayes factors, which do not allow for interval null hypotheses, and may especially prove useful to researchers who use statistical equivalence testing. To facilitate adoption of these Bayes factor tests, we provide easy-to-use software.},

Many findings in psychological science are based on studies with insufficient statistical power and nonrepresentative samples, or may otherwise be limited to specific, ungeneralizable settings or populations. Crowdsourced research, a type of large-scale collaboration in which one or more research projects are conducted across multiple lab sites, offers a pragmatic solution to these and other current methodological challenges. The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) is a distributed network of laboratories designed to enable and support crowdsourced research projects. These projects can focus on novel research questions or replicate prior research in large, diverse samples. The PSA's mission is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science. Here, we describe the background, structure, principles, procedures, benefits, and challenges of the PSA. In contrast to other crowdsourced research networks, the PSA is ongoing (as opposed to time limited), efficient (in that structures and principles are reused for different projects), decentralized, diverse (in both subjects and researchers), and inclusive (of proposals, contributions, and other relevant input from anyone inside or outside the network). The PSA and other approaches to crowdsourced psychological science will advance understanding of mental processes and behaviors by enabling rigorous research and systematic examination of its generalizability.},

  abstract = {False positive findings are a growing problem in many research literatures. We argue that excessive false positives often stem from model uncertainty. There are many plausible ways of specifying a regression model, but researchers typically report only a few preferred estimates. This raises the concern that such research reveals only a small fraction of the possible results and may easily lead to nonrobust, false positive conclusions. It is often unclear how much the results are driven by model specification and how much the results would change if a different plausible model were used. Computational model robustness analysis addresses this challenge by estimating all possible models from a theoretically informed model space. We use large-scale random noise simulations to show (1) the problem of excess false positive errors under model uncertainty and (2) that computational robustness analysis can identify and eliminate false positives caused by model uncertainty. We also draw on a series of empirical applications to further illustrate issues of model uncertainty and estimate instability. Computational robustness analysis offers a method for relaxing modeling assumptions and improving the transparency of applied research.},

Une analyse des processus mentaux qui accompagnent cette phase indique qu'ils se r\'eduisent \`a une combinaison des \'el\'ements suivants: (i) un effort d'imagination et de m\'emoire pour passer en revue les hypoth\`eses possibles qui puissent expliquer les ph\'enom\`enes observ\'es; (ii) les d\'eductions de ces hypoth\`eses et (iii) un acte de volont\'e d'agir conform\'ement \`a une des hypoth\`eses consid\'er\'ees. Par cons\'equent, le terme 'raisonnement inductif" semble d\'eplac\'e et le terme "comportement inductif" para\^it pr\'ef\'erable pour d\'esigner la phase (iii). Les efforts faits pour pr\'eciser le concept de raisonnement inductif conduisent aux formules dogmatiques d\'esign\'ees pour prescrire universellement les degr\'es de confiance qu'un chercheur devrait attribuer aux diff\'erentes hypoth\`eses consid\'er\'ees. A cause du caract\`ere subjectif des degr\'es de confiance, les tentatives d'\'etablir ces formules comme des normes universelles des attitudes, conduisent \`a des controverses anim\'ees. D'autre part, si l'on se rend compte du fait que la suite n\'ecessaire d'une exp\'erience donn\'ee est une action de la part du chercheur, on voit imm\'ediatement que ces disputes sont inutiles. L'avantage de chaque action consid\'er\'ee d\'epend des attitudes individuelles du chercheur et est une fonction des circonstances inconnues, qu'on d\'esigne par le terme "\'etat de l'univers". Si le choix de l'action se fait par une m\'ethode d\'etermin\'ee utilisant les valeurs observ\'ees de quelques variables al\'eatoires dont la loi d\'epend de l'\'etat de l'univers, l'action choisie devient al\'eatoire ellem\^eme, ainsi que l'avantage gagn\'e par cette action. Le probl\`eme de la statistique math\'ematique, consid\'er\'ee comme la th\'eorie math\'ematique du comportement inductif, est de d\'eterminer les r\`egles d'ajuster notre comportement aux valeurs des variables al\'eatoires observ\'ees de telle mani\`ere que la loi de probabilit\'e de l'avantage \`a gagner soit "optimum". La d\'efinition de cet "optimum", ainsi que la d\'efinition de l'avantage d'une action en fonction de l'\'etat de l'univers, sont les circonstances nonstatistiques de la situation et restent \`a la disposition du chercheur, affect\'e par ses propres attitudes et croyances individuelles. La notion (mais pas le terme) du comportement inductif a \'et\'e connue \`a Laplace. Suivant Laplace, elle a \'et\'e adopt\'ee par Gauss. L'adoption du carr\'e de l'erreur d'une estimation statistique comme la mesure du d\'esavantage de cette estimation, et l'adoption de l'esp\'erance math\'ematique du d\'esavantage d'une estimation comme la mesure du d\'esavantage d'une m\'ethode d'estimation sans biais, ont amen\'e Gauss au d\'eveloppement de la m\'ethode des moindres carr\'es. Il semble probable que le traitement moderne des probl\`emes statistiques du point de vue du comportement inductif conduira \`a des d\'eveloppements futurs d'une importance comparable.},

Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive?getting it right?competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive?getting it published.

A key problem, however, is that what is available is the sample-size estimate of the effect size, and its use can lead to severely underpowered studies when the effect size is overestimated. As a potential remedy, we introduce safeguard power analysis, which uses the uncertainty in the estimate of the effect size to achieve a better likelihood of correctly identifying the population effect size. Using a lower-bound estimate of the effect size, in turn, allows researchers to calculate a sample size for a replication study that helps protect it from being underpowered. We show that in most common instances, compared with nominal power, safeguard power is higher whereas standard power is lower. We additionally recommend the use of safeguard power analysis to evaluate the strength of the evidence provided by the original study.},

Simulation shows that these normal results may be adapted to other types of response data. An example shows that group sequential designs can sometimes be statistically superior to standard sequential designs.},

Topics covered include group sequential designs, trials with unplanned interim analyses, estimation problems in clinical trials with planned interim analyses, and the balance between individual and collective ethics. Particular attention is paid to the fact that clinical trials that stop early are prone to exaggerate the magnitude of treatment effect. Accordingly, a Bayesian "shrinkage" method of analysis is proposed to help quantify the extent to which surprisingly large point and interval estimates of treatment difference in clinical trials that stop early should be moderated.},

The usual answer is that quantification is desirable in social investigation as a result of its successes in science. Trust in Numbers questions whether such success in the study of stars, molecules, or cells should be an attractive model for research on human societies, and examines why the natural sciences are highly quantitative in the first place. Theodore Porter argues that a better understanding of the attractions of quantification in business, government, and social research brings a fresh perspective to its role in psychology, physics, and medicine. Quantitative rigor is not inherent in science but arises from political and social pressures, and objectivity derives its impetus from cultural contexts. In a new preface, the author sheds light on the current infatuation with quantitative methods, particularly at the intersection of science and bureaucracy.},

In principle, the assessment of scientific claims is supposed to proceed in a cumulative fashion, with the reigning theories of the day progressively approximating truth more accurately over time. In practice, however, cumulative self-correction tends to proceed less efficiently than one might naively suppose. Far from evaluating new evidence dispassionately and infallibly, individual scientists often cling stubbornly to prior findings. Here we explore the dynamics of scientific self-correction at an individual rather than collective level. In 13 written statements, researchers from diverse branches of psychology share why and how they have lost confidence in one of their own published findings. We qualitatively characterize these disclosures and explore their implications. A cross-disciplinary survey suggests that such loss-of-confidence sentiments are surprisingly common among members of the broader scientific population yet rarely become part of the public record. We argue that removing barriers to self-correction at the individual level is imperative if the scientific community as a whole is to achieve the ideal of efficient self-correction.},

  abstract = {For several years, the public debate in psychological science has been dominated by what is referred to as the reproducibility crisis. This crisis has, inter alia, drawn attention to the need for proper control of statistical decision errors in testing psychological hypotheses. However, conventional methods of error probability control often require fairly large samples. Sequential statistical tests provide an attractive alternative: They can be applied repeatedly during the sampling process and terminate whenever there is sufficient evidence in the data for one of the hypotheses of interest. Thus, sequential tests may substantially reduce the required sample size without compromising predefined error probabilities. Herein, we discuss the most efficient sequential design, the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), and show how it is easily implemented for a 2-sample t test using standard statistical software. We demonstrate, by means of simulations, that the SPRT not only reliably controls error probabilities but also typically requires substantially smaller samples than standard t tests and other common sequential designs. Moreover, we investigate the robustness of the SPRT against violations of its assumptions. Finally, we illustrate the sequential t test by applying it to an empirical example and provide recommendations on how psychologists can employ it in their own research to benefit from its desirable properties.},

Despite these criticisms, this research practice is not uncommon, probably because it appeals to researcher's intuition to collect more data to push an indecisive result into a decisive region. In this contribution, we investigate the properties of a procedure for Bayesian hypothesis testing that allows optional stopping with unlimited multiple testing, even after each participant. In this procedure, which we call Sequential Bayes Factors (SBFs), Bayes factors are computed until an a priori defined level of evidence is reached. This allows flexible sampling plans and is not dependent upon correct effect size guesses in an a priori power analysis. We investigated the long-term rate of misleading evidence, the average expected sample sizes, and the biasedness of effect size estimates when an SBF design is applied to a test of mean differences between 2 groups. Compared with optimal NHST, the SBF design typically needs 50\% to 70\% smaller samples to reach a conclusion about the presence of an effect, while having the same or lower long-term rate of wrong inference.},

In contrast, there is almost no literature that discusses the design of experiments when Bayes factors (BFs) are used as a measure of evidence. Here we explore Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) as a useful tool to design studies for maximum efficiency and informativeness. We elaborate on three possible BF designs, (a) a fixed-n design, (b) an open-ended Sequential Bayes Factor (SBF) design, where researchers can test after each participant and can stop data collection whenever there is strong evidence for either H1 or H0, and (c) a modified SBF design that defines a maximal sample size where data collection is stopped regardless of the current state of evidence. We demonstrate how the properties of each design (i.e., expected strength of evidence, expected sample size, expected probability of misleading evidence, expected probability of weak evidence) can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations and equip researchers with the necessary information to compute their own Bayesian design analyses.},

Not only the analytic approach but also the operationalizations of key variables were left unconstrained and up to individual analysts. For instance, analysts could choose to operationalize status as job title, institutional ranking, citation counts, or some combination. To maximize transparency regarding the process by which analytic choices are made, the analysts used a platform we developed called DataExplained to justify both preferred and rejected analytic paths in real time. Analyses lacking sufficient detail, reproducible code, or with statistical errors were excluded, resulting in 29 analyses in the final sample. Researchers reported radically different analyses and dispersed empirical outcomes, in a number of cases obtaining significant effects in opposite directions for the same research question. A Boba multiverse analysis demonstrates that decisions about how to operationalize variables explain variability in outcomes above and beyond statistical choices (e.g., covariates). Subjective researcher decisions play a critical role in driving the reported empirical results, underscoring the need for open data, systematic robustness checks, and transparency regarding both analytic paths taken and not taken. Implications for organizations and leaders, whose decision making relies in part on scientific findings, consulting reports, and internal analyses by data scientists, are discussed.

Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69\%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31\%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts' prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability. These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions.

Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

As soon as sufficient information has been obtained, data collection is terminated. Here, we compare two sequential hypothesis testing procedures that have recently been proposed for use in psychological research: the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT; Schnuerch \& Erdfelder, 2020) and the Sequential Bayes Factor Test (SBFT; Sch\"onbrodt et al., 2017). We show that although the two methods have been presented as distinct methodologies in the past, they share many similarities and can even be regarded as two instances of the same overarching hypothesis testing framework. We demonstrate that the two methods use the same mechanisms for evidence monitoring and error control, and that differences in efficiency between the methods depend on the exact specification of the statistical models involved. Given the close relationship between the SPRT and SBFT, we argue that the choice of the sequential testing method should be regarded as a continuous choice within a unified framework rather than a dichotomous choice between two methods. We present several considerations researchers can make to navigate the design decisions in the SPRT and SBFT.},

Here, we evaluate this hypothesis by developing an evolutionary agent-based model of a competitive scientific process. We find that rewarding priority of discovery causes populations to culturally evolve towards conducting research with smaller samples. This reduces research reliability and the information-value of the average study. Increased startup costs for setting up single studies and increased payoffs for secondary results (a.k.a. ``scoop protection'') attenuate the negative effects of competition. Further, large rewards for negative results promote the evolution of smaller sample sizes. Our results confirm the logical coherence of ``scoop protection'' reforms at several journals. Our results also imply that reforms to increase scientific efficiency, such as rapid journal turnaround times, may produce collateral damage by incentivizing lower-quality research; in contrast, reforms that increase startup costs, such as preregistration and registered reports, generate incentives for higher-quality research.},

In this study, we develop a research design framework for mixed methods work that is based on the principles of triangulation. Core elements for the research design framework include theoretical purpose, i.e., theory development and/or theory testing; and methodological purpose, i.e., prioritizing generalizability, precision in control and measurement, and authenticity of context. From this foundation, we consider how the multiple methodologies are linked together to accomplish the theoretical purpose, focusing on three types of linking processes: convergent triangulation, holistic triangulation, and convergent and holistic triangulation. We then consider the implications of these linking processes for the theory at hand, taking into account the following theoretical attributes: generality/specificity, simplicity/complexity, and accuracy/inaccuracy. Based on this research design framework, we develop a roadmap that can serve as a design guide for organizational scholars conducting mixed methods research studies.},

This alternative approach enables researchers to tackle ambitious projects that would not be possible under the standard model. Crowdsourced scientific initiatives vary in the degree of communication between project members from largely independent work curated by a coordination team to crowd collaboration on shared activities. The potential benefits and challenges of large-scale collaboration span the entire research process: ideation, study design, data collection, data analysis, reporting, and peer review. Complementing traditional small science with crowdsourced approaches can accelerate the progress of science and improve the quality of scientific research.},

We end by countering several objections to Bayesian hypothesis testing.

The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned\textemdash that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here I argue that many applications of statistical inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology\textemdash the linear mixed model\textemdash I explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that respects researchers' actual generalization intentions. I demonstrate that whereas the "random effect" formalism is used pervasively in psychology to model inter-subject variability, few researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that the failure to  problems many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},
